            <p>My journey into JavaScript began after gaining a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. While these
                technologies allowed me to structure and style web pages, I wanted to add interactivity and dynamic
                functionality to my websites. This curiosity led me to explore JavaScript, the powerful scripting
                language of the web.<br><br>

                I started with online tutorials and free resources such as W3Schools and MDN Web Docs. These platforms
                provided a thorough introduction to JavaScript basics, including variables, data types, functions, and
                event handling. The interactive examples and exercises made the learning process engaging and
                practical.<br><br>

                To deepen my knowledge, I enrolled in beginner-friendly online course on a platform such as
                FreeCodeCamp (Certificate is in my LinkedIn Profile).<br><br>

                However, I recognize that I have trouble to understand and fully solidified my knowledge of JavaScript.
                I continue to dedicate time to learning and practicing these topics,
                knowing that mastery comes with persistence and continuous effort.<br><br>

                My journey with JavaScript is ongoing, and I am committed to refining my skills and staying updated with
                the latest developments in the language. I am excited to continue learning and improving, ultimately
                aiming to create more dynamic and interactive web experiences.
