            <h3>Leon Gal</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm Leon Gal, a passionate and curious aspiring Front-End developer. With a strong interest in
                technology and an insatiable drive to learn new things, I am on an exciting journey into the world of
                software development. Although I am at the beginning of my career, I am always striving to expand and
                develop my
                skills.<br><br>
                I firmly believe that technology has the power to improve people's lives and solve everyday challenges.
                My goal is to develop applications that are not only functional and reliable but also provide a great
                user
                experience. Through continuous learning and experimentation, I want to create software that has a
                positive impact on society.<br><br>

                Programming Languages: still learning JavaScript<br><br>

                Frameworks and Tools: started Angular<br><br>

                Databases: /<br><br>
