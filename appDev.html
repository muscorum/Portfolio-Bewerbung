                My journey into HTML began with a curiosity about how websites are built. I was always fascinated by the
                seamless functionality and beautiful designs of various websites I visited. This curiosity led me to
                explore the foundational technologies behind web <br><br>

                I started with online tutorials and free resources, such as W3Schools and MDN Web Docs, which provided a
                solid grounding in HTML. These platforms offered interactive examples and exercises, making the learning
                process engaging and practical.<br><br>

                To deepen my understanding, I enrolled in a beginner-friendly online course on a platform like
                FreeCodeCamp (Certificate is in my LinkedIn Profile). The course was instrumental in teaching me
                the basics of HTML, including
                elements, tags, attributes, and the structure of a web page.<br><br>

                Additionally, I engaged in hands-on practice by creating simple web pages and small projects. This
                practical approach helped me to solidify my knowledge and gain confidence in my abilities.<br><br>

                Over time, I expanded my learning to include CSS and JavaScript, enabling me to build more dynamic and
                visually appealing websites. This comprehensive understanding of web development has been a rewarding
                journey, and I continue to refine my skills and stay updated with the latest trends and best practices
                in the industry.<br><br>
