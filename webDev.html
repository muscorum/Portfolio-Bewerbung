            <p>My journey into CSS began as a natural progression from learning HTML. After understanding the basics of
                web structure, I wanted to enhance the visual appeal of my web pages and create more engaging user
                experiences. This led me to explore CSS, the language that brings style and aesthetics to web
                development.<br><br>

                I started with online tutorials and free resources like W3Schools and MDN Web Docs, which provided a
                thorough introduction to CSS. These platforms offered interactive examples and exercises that made the
                learning process practical and enjoyable.<br><br>

                To deepen my knowledge, I enrolled in beginner-friendly online course on a platform such as
                FreeCodeCamp (Certificate is in my LinkedIn Profile). The course was instrumental in teaching me the
                fundamentals of CSS, including
                selectors, properties, and the box model, as well as more advanced concepts like flexbox and grid
                layout.<br><br>

                I dedicated a significant amount of time to hands-on practice by styling simple web pages and
                undertaking small projects. This practical approach helped me solidify my understanding and build
                confidence in my styling capabilities.<br><br>

                As I progressed, I started integrating CSS with HTML to create more sophisticated and visually appealing
                websites. This comprehensive approach allowed me to appreciate the interplay between structure and style
                in web development. I continue to refine my skills and stay updated with the latest CSS trends and
                advancements, ensuring that my designs are both modern and effective.
